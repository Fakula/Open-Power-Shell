I often do code-Snippets.

They are free to use, - you can use it on your own.

Licence -> i want to improve my code, my coding skills. - so if you know how to improve the code, i want to know it that everyone can use this "spring".

(if i make the code open, i know its already "public knowledge" :P )
-> if you know something, i want it to know too :D

...

you need Powershell to use that snippets (i guess that is self explained -> power-shell scripts need Powershell as Basis)

-> i prefer Powershell 7 because thats the supportet version from Microsoft 
are there other pre-requesites, they are a special "readme" in the Folders.

disclaimer, i know powershell, but i have no scruples to use AI (copilot is my favorite)
