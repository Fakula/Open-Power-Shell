I will Add a official Lizenze later, but my intention is, 

1) you can use it as often as you want.
2) if you store the code local you have write the source (name and a link to that repository because maybe the code improves)
3) if you have improvements/changes - let me and the world hear it:
3.1) you have to make your changes open.
3.2) i want to improve this "spring" -> give/return your suggestions/improvements.
4)This code is for experienced user who knows what they are doing -> no gurantee (no bad intentions, but errors can happen)


(if you are a Pirate: "Do what you want because a Pirate is free" 
  -> tbf this licence is only a wishfull thinking of me, i have neither the time, recources and desire to enforce it.
  -> so its only a "please do it" licence
)
